    "# Index construction\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's exercise is about constructing an inverted index in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, for the programming exercise, we will look at blocked\n",
    "sort-based indexing.  This is an indexing technique that can be employed when\n",
    "the full index, or some intermediate datastructures do not fit in the main\n",
    "memory of the computer performing the indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic algorithm is outlined in the book in Figure 4.2.  We will provide\n",
    "you with some code that produces a block and reads and writes blocks from and\n",
    "to disk, and leave the implementation of `bsbi_invert()` and the merging part\n",
    "of `merge_blocks()` to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the block you get from `parse_next_block()` is a potentially\n",
    "unordered list of `(termid, docid)` pairs.  The global datastructure\n",
    "`termid_map` can be used to look up term ids by term and the global\n",
    "datastructure `docid_map` can be used to look up documents by id.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our provided implementation of `parse_corpus()` and `parse_next_block()`\n",
    "produces the same document and token ids across executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** Here in the exercise we use an \"optimized\" version of BSBI. With BSBI as you have seen it in the lecture, the intermediate files are lists of raw termID-docID pairs, not postings lists. The postings list is only built at the very end when merging all the intermediate files. It is SPIMI that uses already built partial postings lists as intermediate representation. If this difference is not fully clear to you, we strongly advise you to revise the slides or the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we define some variables. Note the use of python's `namedtuple` factory function which is used here to create simple tuple subclasses that allow us to access tuple fields by name"
